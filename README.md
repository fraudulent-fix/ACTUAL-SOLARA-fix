# THIS IS NOT THE OFFICAL SOLARA: UPDATES WILL NOT BE INSTANTLY ADDED BUT I WILL TRY MY BEST.

The reason i made this fix is because Solara has vulnerabilites in its code and im here to fix them. People can create scripts and use them to rat your pc when you use Solara (blame qui) so i made this fix, its the most recent version. Just run the "Builder" (had to rename it for the code to work) and it'll download the fixed Solara. (Files hidden so skids cant find a bypass.)
